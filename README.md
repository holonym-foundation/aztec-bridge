# Aztec Bridge UI

A comprehensive bridge application for transferring tokens between Ethereum (L1) and Aztec Network (L2), featuring a modern React/Next.js frontend with seamless Web3 integration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **TESTNET ONLY - SECURITY WARNING**

**üö® THIS IS A TESTNET BRIDGE WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES üö®**

- **NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**: This bridge is designed for testing and development purposes only
- **KNOWN SECURITY ISSUES**: The bridge contains known vulnerabilities and should never be used with real funds
- **TESTNET TOKENS ONLY**: Only use with testnet tokens that have no real value
- **NO SECURITY GUARANTEES**: Do not rely on this code for any production or mainnet deployments
- **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE**: This implementation is for learning and testing Aztec network functionality

**‚ö†Ô∏è USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - NEVER USE WITH REAL FUNDS ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## üåü Overview

The Aztec Bridge UI enables users to:
- Bridge tokens between Ethereum Layer 1 and Aztec Layer 2
- Manage multiple token types (ERC20, NFTs)
- Interact with Aztec's privacy-preserving Layer 2 network
- Use sponsored transactions for improved UX
- Connect multiple wallet types including MetaMask and Silk Wallet

- Foundry (for L1 contracts)
- Aztec CLI (for L2 contracts)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd aztec-ui

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
pnpm install

# Install bridge script dependencies
cd ../bridge-script
pnpm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create environment files for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_id
FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/...
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key

# Bridge Scripts (.env)
L1_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/...
MNEMONIC=your_test_mnemonic
PXE_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the frontend development server
cd frontend
pnpm dev

# The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

## üîß Development Scripts

### Frontend Commands

```bash
cd frontend

pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Bridge Scripts

```bash
cd bridge-script

# Bridge operations
node index.js                    # Run main bridge script

## üîê Security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY DISCLAIMER**
**THIS IS A TESTNET BRIDGE WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES - NOT PRODUCTION READY**

This bridge implementation:
- ‚ùå Contains known security vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Has not undergone professional security audits
- ‚ùå Should never be used with real value or on mainnet
- ‚ùå May have unpatched critical security flaws
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Is intended for educational and testing purposes only

### Basic Security Practices Implemented
- ‚úÖ Environment variables for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Proper secret management in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded production credentials
- ‚úÖ Basic input validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **However, these do not address the underlying architectural vulnerabilities**

### Environment Variables
All sensitive information is properly managed through environment variables:
- API keys, private keys, and RPC URLs are never committed
- Production secrets are managed through Vercel and GitHub Secrets
- Test values are clearly marked and separated from production

### Known Limitations
- Bridge contracts may have reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Insufficient access controls in some components
- Lack of comprehensive validation in bridge operations
- Potential for fund loss due to architectural issues
- Missing security features required for production use

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Automated)
The project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment:

```yaml
# Triggers on main branch push
# Deploys to both preview and production environments
# Manages environment variables securely
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy frontend
cd frontend
pnpm build
vercel --prod

# Deploy L1 contracts
cd l1-contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast
```

## üß™ Testing

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test          # Run unit tests
pnpm test:e2e      # Run end-to-end tests
```

### Contract Testing
```bash
cd l1-contracts
forge test         # Test L1 contracts

cd aztec-contracts
aztec test         # Test L2 contracts
```
